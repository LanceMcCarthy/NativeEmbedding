# UI for Xamarin - Native Embedding Demo
This is a demo project that shows you how to embed native platforms controls into a Xamarin.Forms application.

To see the relevant code:
1. Go to the Demo shared project
2. Open MainPage.xaml.cs
3. View MainPage's constructor and see the conditional compilation sections that add the native platform's controls to the MainPage's XAML Grid!

## Dependencies
I used the Telerik NuGet Server to add the UI for Xamarin reference (http://docs.telerik.com/devtools/xamarin/installation-and-deployment/telerik-nuget-server). You can change this to the locally installed version of UI for Xamarin if you prefer.
